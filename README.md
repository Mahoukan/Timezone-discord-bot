This bot automatically detects times mentioned in chat (like “7pm NZDT” or “14:30 AEST”) and converts them into localized Discord timestamps so everyone sees the right time in their own timezone. It also supports manual time conversion commands, schedules events with automatic reminders (30 minutes, 15 minutes, and start time), and can optionally create event threads. The bot helps coordinate gaming sessions, meetings, and activities across different regions with zero confusion.
